# Blockchain
A simple JavaScript blockchain implementation demonstrating core concepts such as block creation, hashing with SHA-256, and proof of work with nonce calculation. This project serves as a learning tool to understand how blockchain technology works under the hood.
# Blockchain Project

This is a simple blockchain implementation using JavaScript and SHA-256 hashing.

Overview

This project demonstrates basic blockchain concepts such as blocks, hashing, proof of work, and chain building.

The blockchain starts with a **Genesis Block** and supports adding new blocks with transactions.

Features

- Create new blocks with nonce and hash
- Calculate block hash using SHA-256
- Implement Proof of Work to find a valid nonce (hash starting with "1111")
- Maintain pending transactions and include them in blocks

Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UroojChaudhary/Blockchain.git
